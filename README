To run our web application please have Flask installed:
1. pip install flask
2. FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run
3. Navigate to localhost:5000

You may look at hello.py to see our server implementation
as well as model.html in the templates directory to see
the code for the frontend of this application. These
are the two main files that we worked with for this 
project.
